When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository would be helpful if multiple people were working on the same project or if you are using multiple computers to develop the same repository. Also a good way to keep a backup of project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository because some changes might either be incomplete or impact other changes you are working on locally. This way your code does not change unexpectedly.
